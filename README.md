I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science in 2018 and with a Masters degree in 2020. I spent around three years working as a data analyst/scientist both on freelance and industry, and after using a lot of Python to automate processes, build ML models and improve data analysis, I've decided to pivot my career towards software development.
