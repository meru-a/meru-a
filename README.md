### Hi there, I'm Meru ðŸ‘‹

I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science in 2018 and with a Masters degree in 2020. I spent around three years working as a data analyst/scientist both on freelance and in the mining and metals industry, and after using a lot of Python to automate processes, build ML models and improve data analysis, I've decided to pivot my career towards software development. I participated in Fall 1 batch of 2023 at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/)!

- ðŸŒ± Currently learning: TypeScript (React, Next.js) and Python (Django, DS)
- ðŸ”¨ Currently working on: [dashcel](https://github.com/pearlescence-m/dashcel) - a cross-platform application for automatic Excel-to-Python dashboard conversion
- ðŸ’¬ Let's talk about web dev, ML, AI, beautiful visualizations and all of the awesome modern things!
