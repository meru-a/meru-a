### Hi there, I'm Meru ðŸ‘‹

I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science in 2018 and with a Masters degree in Computational and Cognitive Neuroscience in 2020. I spent around two years working as a data analyst/scientist in the mining and metals industry and after using a lot of Python to automate processes, build ML models and improve data analysis, I've decided to pivot my career towards software development. 

I am currently participating in a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/)!

- ðŸŒ± Currently learning: TypeScript (React, Next.js, Three.js) and Python (PySide6, Qt)
- ðŸ”¨ Currently working on: [dashcel](https://github.com/pearlescence-m/dashcel) - a desktop cross-platform application for converting Excel file to Python dashboards
- ðŸ’¬ Let's talk about web dev, 3D shaders, desktop apps, ML and all of the lovely modern things!
- âš¡ Fun fact: a superpower I wish I had is elemental manipulation and telepathy is a superpower I'd hate to have
